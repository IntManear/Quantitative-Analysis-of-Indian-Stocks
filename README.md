# Quantitative-Analysis-of-Indian-Stocks

## What is this repository for?
This repository contains Python Notebooks (beginner-friendly) for Stock Analysis of some of the Indian Stocks.
I have tried consolidating the code as much as possible so that there aren't numerous unintuitive notebooks.

The Quant mainly focuses on pairs-trading strategy which is used by many industry professionals. 
Pairs-Trading conventional models deal with co-relation and co-integration of time series but I have tried taking a more from-scratch approach instead of just calling the in-built Python functions so that the intricate workings are easily understood by the reader.

## Pre-requisites?
Pre-requisites for this project aren't many. Some of them are:
1. Understanding of Basic Maths
2. Basic Understanding of Stock Market dynamics.
3. Python basics. (Libraries: Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib should serve as bare mininmum)

## Where can I get the Data?
I was able to get my hands on private data (a company was kind enough tp share it with me). But, you may easily get the daailt ticker data from sites like NSE or Yahoo Finance.
Yahoo Finance has public APIs so you don't have to exlpicitly go out of your way yo get the data.

## What ahead?
These notbooks give a breif idea behind the Quantitative Analysis of Stocks done in the industry. When you're comfortable with these concepts, you can go ahead to do:

1. Creating trading algorithms of your owm. Eg: Upstox in India offers AlgoLab service
2. If you wannaa preactice further. I'd reccomend you checking out a platform called "Quantopian", it does a great job by providing your data as well as working environment.
3. Freelancing to create Quantitative models.

... and the list goes on.
